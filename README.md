# AD-Proiect

## Introduction
The project's scope is to help dog owners to make sure that their beloved pet doesn't cause them issues while they are busy. The app uses the Bluetooth connection between the user's phone and the Arduino board, that lets the owner know when there is movement in the room where the dog is. If no movement is detected, then the owner can continue their work, but otherwise, it is preffered that they would go and check up on what is going on in the other room.  

## The Android App
The application is realised using MIT App Inventor, and contains 4 pages: a starting page, a sign in page, a login page, and a log out page, but most importantly, the page that realizes the connection between the phone and the Arduino, as well as monitors the pet's activity. The authentication and Sign In iare reliant on a Firebase Database, where the accounts and passwords are kept.
